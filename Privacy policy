LedgerPro (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how LedgerPro handles your information when you use our mobile and desktop application.

1. Information We Collect

LedgerPro is designed as an offline-first personal finance application. All data you enter into the app (such as income, expenses, budgets, categories, and preferences) is stored locally on your device using a secure database.

We do not collect, transmit, or process your financial or personal data on external servers.

We do not require account registration to use the app.

2. How Your Information Is Used

Your information is used solely to provide the app’s core functionality, including:

Tracking transactions, budgets, and categories.

Displaying analytics and charts.

Saving your preferences (such as currency selection and theme).

LedgerPro does not use your data for advertising, marketing, or analytics purposes.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to third parties.
Your data remains private and under your control at all times.

If you choose to manually back up or share your data, that process is managed by you and outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.

4. Security of Data

LedgerPro stores data locally on your device using secure storage practices. While we take reasonable steps to safeguard your information, the security of your data also depends on the security of your device.

5. Children’s Privacy

LedgerPro is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store information from children.

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected in the “Last Updated” date above. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.
